Project Name: 
    Cocktail Recipe Database

Project Description:
    The Cocktail Recipe Database is a web app that allows the user to search an API of cocktail recipes and ingredients. The user can search by either name of ingredient, or the name of the cockktail. Searching by cocktail name will aggregate any cocktail recipes contained in the API that contain that name and create a recipe card for each recipe and append them to the DOM. Searching by ingredient will create an ingredient card that gives more information about the searched ingredient and append it to the DOM. When the user completes a new search the prior results will be cleared and the new ones will appear. The user can also clear the DOM by using the "clear search results" button. 

Usage:
    Included below are two screenshots of the application performing a succesful search to provide documentation of what to expect when using the application:
